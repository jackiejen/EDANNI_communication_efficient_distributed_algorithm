# EDANNI_communication_efficient_distributed_algorithm
Code for the paper "A Provably Communication-Efficient Asynchronous Distributed Inference Method for Convex and Nonconvex Problems".
This code solves an example of the sparse PCA problem. For the LASSO problem, the framework of the algorithm is similar with a different subproblem, which can be solved by the same solver.
