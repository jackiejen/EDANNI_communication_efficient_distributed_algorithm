Code for the paper "A Provably Communication-Efficient Asynchronous Distributed Inference Method for Convex and Nonconvex Problems".


This code solves an example of the sparse PCA problem. The framework of the algorithm for the LASSO problem is similar with a different subproblem, which can be solved by the same solver.
